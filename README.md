# Zelda-Like
Zelda-Like for a school project.

# Features
A main menu, Win menu and Lose menu with buttons to interract through the scenes.
The player can move using ZQSD or WASD (keyboard position relative).
He can switch between the sword and the bow with E.
He can attack using the left mouse button.
He can interract with the chest with F.

The Ennemy will attack by throwing potions at the player.
If he is too far, the ennemy will approach the player.

You don't have to kill the ennemy to open the chest though it is complicated while he is here.

Opening the chest only results in getting the Win menu.

# Note
I'm using 3 sets from Kenney for the map: 
The 3 Tiny sets in 2D.
